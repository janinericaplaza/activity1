I’m ricaplaza Janine Claire Riborn on November 23, 2006, in Cebu City, Philippines. 
Growing up in this lively city surrounded by culture and progress, I’ve always been curious about how things work especially technology.
I come from a close-knit family where encouragement and support are constant. 
As the eldest, my parents have always pushed me to dream big, and my biggest dream is to become a professional in IT.
Cebu will always feel like home the friendly people, the sounds of the waves, and the comfort of Filipino food.
</P>

 But it was the first time I touched a computer that truly changed me. 
 Watching my cousins play games and surf the web sparked my curiosity about how technology works.
That curiosity led me to coding, programming, and everything tech-related.
In school, I love math and science because they help me understand the tech world better.
I’m not just someone who reads about it  like tinkering, experimenting, and finding creative solutions.
<p>

Outside of technology, I enjoy reading about personal growth and always strive to become a better version of myself.
 My family taught me the value of perseverance, and that mindset helps me tackle challenges and stay motivated.
 Looking ahead, I’m excited to study Information Technology, focusing on software development and network security.
  I want to contribute to innovative tech companies and help make the digital world safer.
  Beyond that, I hope to give back by teaching young people how to code and be part of the digital future.
  My journey is just starting, and though it won’t be easy, I’m determined to keep learning and growing
